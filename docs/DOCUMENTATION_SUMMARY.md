# Documentation Summary

This document provides an overview of the documentation setup for React Native Multiple Modals.

## What Was Created

### 1. Documentation Structure

A complete Docusaurus-based documentation website with the following pages:

```
docs/docs/
├── intro.md              # Introduction to the library
├── installation.md       # Installation guide
├── usage.md             # Usage examples and patterns
├── api/
│   └── properties.md    # Complete API reference
├── troubleshooting.md   # Common issues and solutions
├── contribution.md      # Contribution guidelines
└── versions.md          # Version compatibility matrix
```

### 2. Content Migrated from README

All content from the main README.md has been organized into structured documentation:

- **Features** → Introduction page
- **Installation** → Dedicated installation guide
- **Usage examples** → Comprehensive usage guide with multiple examples
- **Properties** → Complete API reference with detailed descriptions
- **Troubleshooting** → Enhanced troubleshooting guide
- **Contribution** → Expanded contribution guidelines
- **Versions** → Detailed version compatibility information

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

Created `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` that:
- Automatically builds documentation on changes to `docs/**` or workflow file
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Can be manually triggered
- Uses Node.js 20 for consistency

### 4. Configuration Files

- **docusaurus.config.ts**: Configured for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Base URL: `/react-native-multiple-modals/`
  - Organization: `paufau`
  - Custom navbar and footer
  - Syntax highlighting for TypeScript/TSX
  
- **sidebars.ts**: Organized sidebar with logical grouping
  - Introduction
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - API Reference
  - Troubleshooting
  - Contribution
  - Versions

### 5. Supporting Documentation

- **docs/README.md**: Developer guide for the documentation
- **docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **docs/DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This summary file

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
The documentation automatically deploys when:
1. Changes are pushed to `main` branch in `docs/` folder
2. The workflow file is modified
3. Manually triggered via GitHub Actions

### Manual Setup Required
The repository maintainer needs to:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Verify workflow permissions

See `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## Live URL

Once deployed, the documentation will be available at:
**https://paufau.github.io/react-native-multiple-modals/**

## Local Development

To run the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm start
```

This opens a development server at `http://localhost:3000`

## Building

To build the documentation:

```bash
cd docs
npm run build
```

The static files will be generated in `docs/build/`

## Maintenance

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new `.md` file in `docs/docs/`
2. Add frontmatter with `sidebar_position`
3. Update `sidebars.ts` if needed
4. Commit and push

### Updating Content

1. Edit the relevant `.md` file
2. Test locally with `npm start`
3. Commit and push
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy

### Adding Images

1. Place images in `docs/static/img/`
2. Reference in markdown: `![Alt text](img/filename.png)`
